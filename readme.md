# HIP Graph Tests

This repository contains various HIP Graph tests and corresponding scripts to compile, run, and generate plots from the results. 

"HIP graphs are an alternative way of executing tasks on a GPU that can provide performance benefits over launching kernels using the standard method via streams. A HIP graph is made up of nodes and edges. The nodes of a HIP graph represent the operations performed, while the edges mark dependencies between those operations." [AMD HIP Docs](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/docs-develop/how-to/hip_runtime_api/hipgraph.html)

HIP Graphs can help optimize performance by reducing CPU overhead and improving GPU utilization on AMD hardware.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Machine with **AMD GPU** that support **ROCm** (refer to [Supported GPUs](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/develop/reference/system-requirements.html))
- **ROCm toolkit** (ensuring `hipcc` is in your PATH, refer to [Install HIP Guide](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/develop/install/install.html)).
- A **C++ compiler** supporting HIP (e.g., GCC on a ROCm-enabled system).
- **Python 3** and following plotting libraries: `matplotlib`, `pandas`, & `numpy`.

### Repository Structure (Simplified)
- **`complex-3diff-kernels-test/`**  
  Contains the source file `combined_3diff_kernels.cpp` and outputs a CSV file (e.g., `complex_3_different_kernels.csv`).
- **`compelx-diffsize-kernels-test/`**  
  Contains the source file `combined_diffsize_kernels_singlerun.cpp` and outputs a CSV file (e.g., `complex_different_sizes_kernels.csv`).
- **`complex-multi-malloc-test/`**  
  Contains the source file `combined_multi_malloc_singlerun.cpp` and outputs a CSV file (e.g., `complex_multi_malloc.csv`).
- **`complex-multi-stream-test/`**  
  Contains the source file `combined_multi_stream_singlerun.cpp` and outputs a CSV file (e.g., `complex_multi_stream_kernels.csv`).
- **`plot_generator.py`**  
  A Python script that reads CSV files and generates plots in a designated output directory.
- **`run_tests.sh`**  
  A bash script that compiles each test and runs them sequentially, producing CSV output files. Additionally, execute `generate_plots.sh` script at the end.
- **`generate_plots.sh`**  
  A bash script that invokes `plot_generator.py` using the relevant CSV files, saving plots in an output directory.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hamani115/hip-graph-tests.git
    cd hip-graph-tests
    ```

2. **Run the tests and generate plots**:
    ```bash
    bash run_tests.sh
    ```
   This single script will:
   - Compile each of the HIP test programs (using `hipcc --offload-arch=<gfx_target>`).
   - Execute them with predefined arguments (generating CSV files).
   - Call `generate_plots.sh`, which runs `plot_generator.py` to create plots from the CSV results.

3. **Check the results**:
   - **CSV files** are generated in each testâ€™s directory (e.g., `complex_3_different_kernels.csv`).
   - **Plots** are stored in a default output directory (e.g., `./output_plots_AMD`).

## Customizing the Tests or Plots

- #### **Modifying Test Parameters**  
  In the `run_test.sh` bash script, there are variables for the test paramters that are passed as arguments to the executable file of each test. The arguments can be passed for the `.cpp` file:
  1. `NSTEPS`: The number of initial iterations that the HIP Graph will be launched.
  2. `SKIPBY`: The number of initial iterations to skip from timing measurements.
  3. `NUM_RUNS`: The number of times the test will be repeated. This affects the average and standard deviation calculations, which in turn influence the plotted values and error bars.
  4. `FILENAME`: The name of the CSV file where the test results will be written.

  **Note**: Each test directory (e.g., `complex-kernels-test/`, `diffsize-kernels-test/`) contains a `.cpp` source file and a corresponding executable (generated after compilation).

- #### **Adding/Removing CSV Files**  
  If you add new tests producing additional CSV files or remove existing ones, update the `CSV_FILES` array in `generate_plots.sh` accordingly. Any CSV path listed there will be passed to `plot_generator.py`.

- #### **Using a Different Python Script**  
  If you have multiple Python scripts for plotting, modify `PYTHON_SCRIPT` in `generate_plots.sh` to point to your desired script. Ensure it accepts the same arguments (CSV paths, output directory) or adjust the script accordingly.

- #### **Changing the Output Directory**  
  By default, plots are saved to `./output_plots_AMD`. You can change the `OUTPUT_DIR` variable in `generate_plots.sh` if you want them placed elsewhere.

## Notes

- The **`OFFLOAD_ARCH`** (e.g., `gfx1100`) is set in `run_tests.sh`. Update it to match your target AMD GPU architecture if needed.
- Make sure your environment has the required Python packages to run the plotting scripts.
- For more detailed control, you may compile and run each `.cpp` file separately with `hipcc` and then manually call `plot_generator.py`.
